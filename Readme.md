## Cloud Computing Project

This project is built for controlling the virtual machine and the virtual machines in it using pyvblox library and python back-end framework called Flask.

To do this we built an API using flask that will containt multiple routes , each route represents a functionality like listing the virtual machines , launching a virtual machine , configuring a virtual machine...

Also this project has an interface built using Bootstrap to make it easy for the user to manipulate the virtualBox in his host machine.
